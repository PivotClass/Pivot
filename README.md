## Installation (instructions for anyone who wants to test it at any point)

We'll deploy this on Heroku later. To run on local server, you will need to download Node.js with NextJS.

### Steps

1. Get a stable release of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Clone this GitHub repository.
3. Open the root directory and run `npm install` to obtain the necessary node_modules components. 
4. Run `npm run dev` and a Node.js runtime environment should open at `localhost:3000`.
