## Overview
Check it out: https://pivoted.space/

Pivot is a project created for IvyHacks 2020. You can learn more at our [Devpost submission](https://devpost.com/software/pivot-9ytkdq).

You can also find Pivot at https://pivotroom.herokuapp.com (should be the same link to the same server)

## Installation

Pivot is already deployed on Heroku. If you want to run it on your local server, you will need to download Node.js with NextJS. Do the usual yadda yadda...
```
npm install
```

### Steps

1. Get a stable release of [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).
2. Clone this GitHub repository.
3. Open the root directory and run `npm install` to obtain the necessary node_modules components. 
4. Run `npm run dev` and a Node.js runtime environment should open at `localhost:3000`.

A production version can be built and run using the following
```
npm run-script build
PORT=3000 npm start
```
